# Ralph PRD Converter

Converts existing PRDs to the prd.json format that Ralph uses for autonomous execution.

---

## The Job

Take a PRD (markdown file or text) and convert it to `scripts/ralph/prd.json`.

---

## Output Format

```json
{
  "project": "Untangle",
  "branchName": "ralph/[feature-name-kebab-case]",
  "description": "[Feature description from PRD title/intro]",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "[Story title]",
      "description": "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Criterion 1",
        "Criterion 2",
        "npm run typecheck passes"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

## Story Size: The #1 Rule

**Each story must be completable in ONE Ralph iteration (~one context window).**

Ralph spawns a fresh Amp instance per iteration with no memory of previous work. If a story is too big, the LLM runs out of context before finishing and produces broken code.

### Right-sized stories:
- Add a database column + migration
- Add a UI component to an existing page
- Update a server action with new logic
- Add a filter dropdown to a list

### Too big (split these):
- "Build the entire dashboard" → Split into: schema, queries, UI components, filters
- "Add authentication" → Split into: schema, middleware, login UI, session handling
- "Refactor the API" → Split into one story per endpoint or pattern

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't describe the change in 2-3 sentences, it's too big.

---

## Story Ordering: Dependencies First

Stories execute in priority order. Earlier stories must not depend on later ones.

**Correct order:**
1. Schema/database changes (migrations)
2. Server actions / backend logic
3. UI components that use the backend
4. Dashboard/summary views that aggregate data

**Wrong order:**
1. ❌ UI component (depends on schema that doesn't exist yet)
2. ❌ Schema change

---

## Acceptance Criteria: Must Be Verifiable

Each criterion must be something Ralph can CHECK, not something vague.

### Good criteria (verifiable):
- "Add `investorType` column to investor table with default 'cold'"
- "Filter dropdown has options: All, Cold, Friend"
- "Clicking toggle shows confirmation dialog"
- "npm run typecheck passes"
- "npm test passes"

### Bad criteria (vague):
- ❌ "Works correctly"
- ❌ "User can do X easily"
- ❌ "Good UX"
- ❌ "Handles edge cases"

### Always include as final criterion:
```
"npm run typecheck passes"
```

For stories with testable logic, also include:
```
"npm test passes"
```

### For stories that change UI, also include:
```
"Verify in browser using dev-browser skill"
```

Frontend stories are NOT complete until visually verified. Ralph will use the dev-browser skill to navigate to the page, interact with the UI, and confirm changes work.

---

## Conversion Rules

1. **Each user story → one JSON entry**
2. **IDs**: Sequential (US-001, US-002, etc.)
3. **Priority**: Based on dependency order, then document order
4. **All stories**: `passes: false` and empty `notes`
5. **branchName**: Derive from feature name, kebab-case, prefixed with `ralph/`
6. **Always add**: "npm run typecheck passes" to every story's acceptance criteria

---

## Splitting Large PRDs

If a PRD has big features, split them:

**Original:**
> "Add friends outreach track with different messaging"

**Split into:**
1. US-001: Add investorType field to database
2. US-002: Add type toggle to investor list UI  
3. US-003: Create friend-specific phase progression logic
4. US-004: Create friend message templates
5. US-005: Wire up task generation for friends
6. US-006: Add filter by type
7. US-007: Update new investor form
8. US-008: Update dashboard counts

Each is one focused change that can be completed and verified independently.

---

## Example

**Input PRD:**
```markdown
# Friends Outreach

Add ability to mark investors as "friends" for warm outreach.

## Requirements
- Toggle between cold/friend on investor list
- Friends get shorter follow-up sequence (3 instead of 5)
- Different message template asking for deck feedback
- Filter list by type
```

- [ ] Each story is completable in one iteration (small enough)
- [ ] Stories are ordered by dependency (schema → backend → UI)
- [ ] Every story has "npm run typecheck passes" as criterion
- [ ] UI stories have "Verify in browser using dev-browser skill" as criterion
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are verifiable (not vague)
- [ ] No story depends on a later story
